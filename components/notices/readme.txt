Scripturian
===========

Scripturian is a library that makes it easy to integrate various programming and templating
languages into your JVM-based software. It is designed from the ground-up for high performance
concurrent execution, and as such offers a scalable alternative to the Java scripting standard
(JSR-223). 

A comprehensive manual is available online, on the Scripturian web site:
