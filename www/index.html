Any application that generates text can make good use of it, at the minimum as a templating solution, but at the maximum as a fully programmatic way to generate text. For example, a blogging or content management application can use it to give users complete control over theming/skinning. </p>     <p>It's not always easy to configure and start arbitrary scripting engines, contexts, etc. Scripturian does it all for you. For example, any file with <span style="font-family: monospace">&lt;%python</span> at the beginning will start the appropriate script engine. It's a straightforward equivalent of the <span style="font-family: monospace">#!/</span> used by shells.</p>     <p>Finally, it provides an easy way to bootstrap Java applications using scripting, by delegating the main() method straight into an embedded script. It makes it easy to quickly make changes in how your applications starts up without recompiling it.</p>   <h3>Supported Scripting Languages</h3>   <ul>   <li>JavaScript</li>     <li>PHP<br />   </li>     <li>Python</li>     <li>Ruby</li>     <li>Groovy <br />   </li>   </ul>   <h3>Uses</h3>   <p>The <a href="http://www.restlet.org/">Restlet</a>  framework has an optional extension that uses Scripturian to allow for implementing REST resources in script, generating HTML with embedded scripts, and bootstrapping the Restlet components. The result is that it's possible to develop very powerful REST applications using only scripting languages, effectively allowing for &quot;Ruby on Restlet&quot;, &quot;Python on Restlet&quot;, etc.<br />   </p>
